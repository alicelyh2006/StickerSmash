<h2>First app built following the Youtube tutorial by Beto from Expo! </h2>
<p>I'm pretty happy with the results, learnt about how to build an app from scratch, how to add files one by one and how do they complement each other.</p>
<p>Sharing my code here so anyone who's building StickerSmash too can have a look! </p>
<p>However, there's one problem yet to be solve: Once I added a sticker and pressed the add sticker button again, everything freezes and I can't press on anything anymore. If anyone has the solution to it do let me know, thank you!</p>
